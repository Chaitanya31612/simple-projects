       for their money. Also due to their consistency they are number 1 brand in India. Also they are giving tough 
      competition to other companies. Apple is one of the largest selling smartphone brand all over the globe and 
   there is a huge fan base just for there design and premium service and all over small smartphone brand try to 
copy there design and the innovation that apple does this is due to the fact that small smartphone brands do not have
much courage to try to innovate because if their innovation doesn't work out they cannot withstand with the loss as  
there market and sale are at local level so they wait for companies like samsung and apple to innovate and if people liked
the thing they impliment that to their phone and try to provide user with fake iphone at very less price. </p>
